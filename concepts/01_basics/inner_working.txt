# How code gets executed ?
  * Compilation + Run
  * Python code gets converted to bytecode
  * Bytecode is not a machine code
  * Bytecode is python specific
  * Bytecode fed to the Python Virtual Machine
  * PVM execites it line by line

# Python Shell
  * Enter python shell using command 'python' on terminal
  * Helps in finding the output of our scripts 
  * We can use it in debugging

# Mutable/Immutable
  * Mutable
    - Set
    - List
    - Array
  
  * Immutable
    - Integer
    - Float
    - String
    - boolean

  * What does it mean ?
    - Mutable mean we can chnage the value of a variable 
    - Immutable mean we can't change
    - In python when we assign a new value to the previously defined variable then all Immutable
      variable got new value with some new reference but prev ref still exists in memory and 
      collected by garbage collector if no one is using that reference
